          Background
        </h2>
        <p>
          With the rising availability of a wide range of head-mounted
          displays as well as platform APIs for environment sensing,
          augmented and virtual reality (collectively known as XR) has recently emerged as a critical field of evolution for human-machine interactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Web provides a promising preexisting ecosystem for the creation,
          distribution, and experiencing of XR content, applications, and
          services.
        </p>
        <p>
          As explored during the <a href=
          "https://www.w3.org/2016/06/vr-workshop/report.html">October 2016 W3C
          Workshop</a>, a first step in exploiting that potential relies on
          allowing browsers to display and react to content adapted to
          available head-mounted displays and to handheld devices in "magic window" mode. The <a href=
          "https://www.w3.org/community/webvr/">Community-Group incubated</a>
          <a href="https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr/">WebXR Device API</a> has already
          gained interest from a number of implementors, and this Working Group
          thus aims at building on that momentum to standardize it as part of
          the Open Web Platform.
        </p>
      </section>

        <h2>
          Scope
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Immersive Web Working Group will develop standardized APIs to provide
          access to input and output capabilities commonly associated with
          XR hardware such as Googleâ€™s Daydream, the Oculus Rift,
          the Samsung GearVR, the HTC Vive, and Windows Mixed Reality
          headsets and sensors as well as mobile handheld devices in "magic window" mode.
          In other words, the WG will develop an API to enable the creation of XR web sites.
          This XR experience must be embeddable in the Web of today to
          allow progressive enhancement of existing web sites.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <strong>scope</strong> of the Immersive Web Working Group charter is to
          define APIs which:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Enable a Web page to detect available XR devices and sensors.
          </li>
          <li>Allow querying a XR device for device-specific capabilities.
          </li>
          <li>Receive updated information about the device's position and orientation over time.
          </li>
          <li>Receive updated information about the device's environment.
          </li>
          <li>Present imagery to the device at the device's native frame rate.
          </li>
          <li>Provide information about XR specific input, including tracked controller state and hand gesture.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Out of scope</strong>:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Define how a XR browser would work.</li>

            at least two independent implementations</a> of each feature
            defined in the specification.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each specification should contain a section detailing any known
            security or privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and
            end users.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each specification should have an associated testing plan developed
            in parallel, and completed by the time the specification reaches
            Candidate Recommendation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each specification should contain a section describing known
            impacts on accessibility to users with disabilities, ways the
            specification features address them, and recommendations for
            minimizing accessibility problems in implementation.

          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#confidentiality-levels">
          public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face
          meetings will be archived for public review, and technical
          discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can
          be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and
          Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public
          repository, and may permit direct public contribution requests. The
          meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables,
          issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be
          available from the <a class="todo" href="TODO">Immersive Web Working Group home page.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Immersive Web Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of
          particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed
          basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work on the public
          mailing list <a href=
          "mailto:public-webvr-wg@w3.org">public-webvr-wg@w3.org</a> (<a href=
          "http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webvr-wg/">archive</a>)
          and on <a id="public-github" href=
          "https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr/issues">GitHub issues</a>. The public
          is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for
          administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and
          members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases
          when a participant requests such a discussion.

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due
          process, per the <a href=
          "https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#Consensus">W3C Process
          Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant
          makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with
          members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with
          little formal voting being required.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but
          consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of
          views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, and record a
          decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any
          resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face
          meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional. A call for
          consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via
          email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from one week
          to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group
          consensus on the issue. If no objections are raised on the mailing
          list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be
          considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless
          and until new information becomes available, or unless reopened at
          the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href=

          Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a>, and includes no voting procedures
          beyond what the Process Document requires.

          Background
        </h2>
        <p>
          A new generation of head-mounted displays and environment sensing 
          capabilities on mobile devices are enabling augmented and virtual reality 
          (collectively known as XR) to emerge as a critical field of evolution for 
          human-machine interactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to its inherent low friction and support for ephemeral experiences, 
          the Web provides a promising ecosystem for the creation,
          distribution, and experiencing of XR content, applications, and
          services.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <a href=
          "https://www.w3.org/2016/06/vr-workshop/report.html">October 2016 W3C
          Workshop</a> explored that potential, relying on browsers to display and 
          interact with content using available head-mounted displays and handheld 
          devices providing a window into virtual space. The <a href=
          "https://www.w3.org/community/immersive-web/">Community-Group incubated</a>
          <a href="https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr/">WebXR Device API</a> has 
          already gained interest from a number of implementors. This Working Group
          will build on that momentum to standardize the WebXR Device API as part of
          the Open Web Platform.

        <h2>
          Scope
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Immersive Web Working Group will develop standardized APIs to provide
          access to input and output capabilities commonly associated with
          XR hardware such as Google’s Daydream, the Oculus Rift,
          the Samsung GearVR, the HTC Vive, and Windows Mixed Reality
          headsets and sensors as well as mobile handheld devices and standalone 
          headsets such as the Oculus Go and Lenovo Mirage Solo.
          The WG will develop APIs to enable the creation of XR web experiences 
          that are embeddable in the Web of today, enabling progressive enhancement 
          of existing sites.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <strong>scope</strong> of the Immersive Web Working Group charter is to
          define APIs which:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Detect available XR devices and sensors.
          </li>
          <li>Query XR devices for device-specific capabilities.
          </li>
          <li>Receive updated information about the device's position and orientation over time.
          </li>
          <li>Receive updated information about the device's environment.
          </li>
          <li>Present imagery to the device at the device's native frame rate, using the device’s position and orientation over time to provide an immersive experience.
          </li>
          <li>Provide information about XR specific input, including tracked controller state and hand gesture.
          </li>
          <li>For augmenting reality on devices which support AR, enable XR sessions that provide real-world display, and provide the ability to hit-test surfaces in the real world.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Out of scope</strong>:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Defining browser user experience inside virtual or augmented reality,
            aside from navigating between XR sites.
          </li>
          <li>Defining mechanisms for global-scale AR browsing.
          </li>

            "Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each
            specification is expected to have <a href=
            "https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#implementation-experience">
            at least two independent implementations</a> of each feature
            defined in the specification.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each specification should contain a section detailing any known
            security or privacy implications and considerations for implementers, 
            Web authors, and end users.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each specification will have an associated testing plan developed
            in parallel, and will be completed when the specification reaches
            Candidate Recommendation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each specification will contain a section describing known
            impacts on accessibility to users with disabilities, ways the
            specification features address them, and recommendations for
            minimizing accessibility problems in implementation.

          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#confidentiality-levels">
          public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face
          meetings will be archived for public review, and technical
          discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can
          be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and
          Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public
          repository, and may permit direct public contribution requests. The
          meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.

          Information about the group (including details about deliverables,
          issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be

        <p>
          Most Immersive Web Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of
          particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed
          basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work in  <a id="public-github" href="https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr/issues">GitHub issues</a> and 
          on the public mailing list <a href=
          "mailto:public-immersive-web-wg@w3.org">public-immersive-web-wg@w3.org</a> (<a href=
          "http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-immersive-web-wg/">archive</a>). The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for
          administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and
          members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases
          when a participant requests such a discussion.

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due
          process, per the <a href=
          "https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#Consensus">W3C Process
          Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant
          makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with
          members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with
          little formal voting being required.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but
          consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of
          views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, and record a
          decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any
          resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face
          meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional. A call for
          consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via
          email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from one week
          to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group
          consensus on the issue. If no objections are raised on the mailing
          list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be
          considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless
          and until new information becomes available, or unless reopened at
          the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href=
          "https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">W3C Process
          Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a>, and includes no voting procedures
          beyond what the Process Document requires.

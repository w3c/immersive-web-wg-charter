        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>With the rising availability of a wide range of head-mounted displays, Virtual Reality (VR) has recently emerged as a critical field of evolution for human-machine interactions.</p>
        <p>The Web provides a promising preexisting ecosystem for the creation, distribution, and experiencing of VR content, applications, and services.</p>
        <p>As explored during the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/06/vr-workshop/report.html">October 2016 W3C Workshop</a>, a first step in exploiting that potential relies on allowing browsers to display and react to content adapted to available head-mounted displays. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webvr/">Community-Group incubated</a> <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webvr/">WebVR API </a> has already gained interest from a number of implementors, and this Working Group thus aims at building on that momentum to standardize it as part of the Open Web Platform.</p>
        <p>The WebVR Working Group will develop standardized APIs to provide access to input and output capabilities commonly associated with Virtual Reality hardware  such as Google’s Daydream, the Oculus Rift, the Samsung Gear VR, the HTC Vive, and Windows Mixed Reality headsets. In other words, the WG will develop an API to allow Virtual Reality web sites that one can view in a VR headset.  This VR experience must be embeddable in the Web of today to allow progressive enhancement of existing web sites.</p>

        <p><strong>Goals</strong> - Develop APIs to enable Virtual Reality applications on the web by allowing Web pages to do the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Detect available Virtual Reality devices.</li>
          <li>Query the devices capabilities.</li>
          <li>Poll the device’s position and orientation.</li>
          <li>Display imagery on the device at the appropriate frame rate.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Non-goals</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Define how a Virtual Reality browser would work.</li>
          <li>Take full advantage of Augmented Reality devices.</li>
        </ul>
        <div>
          <h3>Success Criteria</h3>
          <p>In order to advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each specification is expected to have <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#implementation-experience">at least two independent implementations</a> of each of feature defined in the specification.</p>
          <p>Each specification should contain a section detailing any known security or privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>

          <p>Each specification should have an associated testing plan developed in parallel, and completed by the time the specification reaches Candidate Recommendation.</p>
          
          <p>Each specification should contain a section describing known impacts on accessibility to users with disabilities, ways the specification features address them, and recommendations for minimizing accessibility problems in implementation.</p>

        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/Charter.html#horizontal-review">horizontal review</a> for accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>. Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a>, and should be issued when major changes occur in a specification.</p>


        <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>

          Participation
        </h2>
        <p>
          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.

          Communication

        <p id="public">
          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository, and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="">WebVR Working Group home page.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most WebVR Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work  on the public mailing list <a href="mailto:public-webvr-wg@w3.org">public-webvr-wg@w3.org</a> (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webvr-wg/">archive</a>)
          and on <a id="public-github" href="https://github.com/w3c/webvr/issues/">GitHub issues</a>.
          The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/policies#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available, or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a>, and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
